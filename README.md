Greetings from my GitHub repository!
As a first-year student of computer science, I upload my C programs here.
This repository is primarily used to track all of my assignments and small projects, hone my logic-building abilities, and practice programming.
Concerning This Archive:
.There are basic C programs in this repository that are connected to:
 .Simple input/output
 .Statements with conditions (if/else)
 .Loops (do-while, while, and for)
 .functions
 .Strings and arrays
 .Managing files
 .Pointer fundamentals
 .Small assignments and projects
 As I pick up new ideas, I'll continue to update this repository.
